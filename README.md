  Best JavaScript Web API on the Planet!

# How to use this API

To use this api, put the JavaScript from the ``api.js`` file into another JavaScript file, or paste the api.js file into your website.
Then declare the file within your HTML file with the following code:

```html
<script src="api.js"></script>
```

You can then choose whatever input you would like to then run the API, e.g. a Button or a Text Input.

# How it works (sorta)

Tank API uses the Discord CDN to add pictures directly into the HTML with JavaScript, aswell as using CSS with JavaScript.

*I can't explain this well*
